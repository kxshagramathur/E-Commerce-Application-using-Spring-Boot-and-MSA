# ðŸ›’ Microservices-based E-Commerce Architecture

This repository showcases a scalable and modular e-commerce system built using the microservices architecture.  
Core features like user management, product catalog, order processing, and payment are handled by independent services.  
Technologies used include **Spring Boot**, **Eureka**, **API Gateway**, **MySQL**, and **Zipkin** for distributed tracing.  
The system is designed for high performance, resilience, and ease of deployment in cloud-native environments.
